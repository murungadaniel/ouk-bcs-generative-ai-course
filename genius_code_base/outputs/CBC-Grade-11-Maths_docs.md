# Codebase Documentation

## Overview
This repository appears to serve as a collection of educational resources for Grade 11 Mathematics, specifically aligned with the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). It primarily contains Portable Document Format (PDF) files, which are likely revision questions, notes, or question and answer sets designed for students.

## Repository Structure
The repository exhibits a flat structure where all content files are located directly in the root directory.

## Key Files and Responsibilities
*   **`CBC Grade 11 Maths Q & A.pdf`**: This PDF document likely contains a set of questions along with their corresponding answers, covering topics relevant to Grade 11 CBC Mathematics.
*   **`Grade 11 Maths Revision Questions.pdf`**: This PDF document probably offers additional practice or revision questions for students studying Grade 11 CBC Mathematics.
*   **`README.md`**: This file provides a basic overview or introductory description for the repository.

## How to Run Locally
This repository does not contain executable code in the traditional software development sense. To "run" or access the content locally, users simply need to:
1.  Clone or download the repository to their local machine.
2.  Open the `.pdf` files using any standard PDF viewer (e.g., Adobe Acrobat Reader, web browser built-in PDF viewer, etc.).

## Possible Improvements
*   **Categorization of Documents**: As the number of documents grows, organizing PDFs into logical subdirectories (e.g., by topic, term, or type like 'Notes', 'Questions', 'Solutions') would significantly improve navigation and user experience.
*   **Enhanced `README.md`**: The `README.md` could be expanded to provide more detailed information, such as:
    *   A clearer introduction to the CBC curriculum context for these materials.
    *   A brief description of the specific content or topics covered in each PDF file.
    *   Information about the target audience or prerequisites.
    *   Instructions for contributing new materials (if contributions are desired).
*   **Solutions for Revision Questions**: If the "Grade 11 Maths Revision Questions.pdf" does not include solutions, providing a separate document with answers would be highly beneficial for students to self-assess their understanding.
*   **Metadata and Versioning**: For educational content, including creation dates, last updated dates, or even specific curriculum module numbers within the `README.md` or as metadata for each file could be useful. If the content changes over time, clear versioning could help track updates.
*   **Licensing**: Adding a `LICENSE` file would explicitly define how the educational materials can be used, shared, or adapted by others, promoting clarity and proper attribution.
