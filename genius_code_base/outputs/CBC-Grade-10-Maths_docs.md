# Codebase Documentation

## Overview
This repository, `CBC-Grade-10-Maths`, appears to be a collection of educational resources related to the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) for Grade 10 Mathematics. Its primary purpose is likely to provide learning materials, exercises, or interactive content for students and educators following this curriculum framework. The "INNODEMS" organization suggests an affiliation with educational innovation and development, possibly within the Kenyan context given the target audience of the Open University of Kenya.

## Repository Structure
Based on the repository name, the structure is likely organized to facilitate access to different mathematical topics or modules for Grade 10. A probable structure would include:

*   A `README.md` file at the root providing an introduction to the project.
*   Folders dedicated to specific modules or topics (e.g., `Algebra`, `Geometry`, `Statistics`, or `Module_1`, `Module_2`).
*   Within these module/topic folders, content could be organized with:
    *   `index.html` files serving as entry points for web-based lesson pages.
    *   `styles.css` files for styling web content.
    *   `script.js` files for interactive elements or dynamic content.
    *   `images/` directories containing diagrams, charts, or illustrations.
    *   `.pdf` files for static lesson notes, exercises, or solutions.
*   Other standard repository files like `LICENSE` or `.gitignore` may also be present.

*Note: The exact directory and file names are inferred based on the repository's purpose and common practices for educational content repositories, as direct file tree access is not available.*

## Key Files and Responsibilities
*   **`README.md`**: Provides a high-level overview of the project, its purpose, and potentially instructions on how to use or navigate the educational materials.
*   **`.html` files (e.g., `index.html` within module folders)**: These would serve as the main web pages displaying the lesson content, explanations, or problems.
*   **`.css` files**: Responsible for the visual presentation and styling of the HTML content, ensuring a consistent and readable interface.
*   **`.js` files**: If present, these would handle interactive elements, quizzes, dynamic content loading, or other functionalities to enhance the learning experience.
*   **`.pdf` files**: Likely contain static documents such as detailed notes, worksheets, exercises, or solution sets for various mathematical topics.
*   **`images/` directory**: Stores all visual assets like graphs, diagrams, mathematical illustrations, or instructional images used within the HTML or PDF content.

## How to Run Locally
Given the likely nature of this repository as a collection of static educational content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PDFs), running it locally is straightforward:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/INNODEMS/CBC-Grade-10-Maths.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the repository directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CBC-Grade-10-Maths
    ```
3.  **View the content:**
    *   To view web-based lessons: Locate an `.html` file (e.g., `index.html` in a module folder or at the root) and open it directly with any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    *   To view PDF documents: Navigate to any `.pdf` file and open it with a standard PDF reader (e.g., Adobe Acrobat Reader, built-in browser PDF viewer).

No special server setup or build process is typically required for this type of content.

## Possible Improvements
*   **Interactive Quizzes and Exercises:** Integrate more interactive elements beyond static content, such as self-grading quizzes, drag-and-drop activities, or simulations to enhance engagement.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Ensure the content adheres to web accessibility guidelines (WCAG) for learners with disabilities (e.g., alt text for images, keyboard navigation, clear semantic HTML).
*   **Navigation and Search:** Implement improved navigation menus, a clear table of contents, or even a search function to help users quickly find specific topics or lessons.
*   **Version Control Best Practices:** If multiple contributors are involved, establish clear branching strategies, commit message conventions, and pull request review processes.
*   **Offline Access Package:** Provide a bundled download option (e.g., a `.zip` file) that includes all materials, allowing users to access the content without an internet connection.
*   **Performance Optimization:** For web-based content, optimize image sizes, minify CSS/JS, and implement caching strategies to improve loading times.
*   **Clearer Licensing:** Ensure a `LICENSE` file is present and clearly states how the educational materials can be used, shared, and adapted.
