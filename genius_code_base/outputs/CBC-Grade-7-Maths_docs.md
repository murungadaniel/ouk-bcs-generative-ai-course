# Codebase Documentation

## Overview
This repository, "CBC-Grade-7-Maths," appears to be an educational resource focused on Mathematics for Grade 7, likely aligned with the Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC). Based on the name, it is intended to provide learning materials, notes, or exercises for students or teachers. It most likely contains static web content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and possibly image assets or PDF documents related to the curriculum.

## Repository Structure
(Assumed structure based on common educational resource repositories and project naming conventions. A more precise structure would require direct file listing.)

*   `README.md`: Provides a general overview and potentially instructions for the repository.
*   `/images/`: Directory for storing image assets, such as diagrams, charts, or illustrations.
*   `/css/`: Directory containing stylesheet files (e.g., `style.css`) for visual presentation.
*   `/js/`: Directory for JavaScript files (e.g., `script.js`) that might add interactivity.
*   `/docs/` or `/assets/`: Possible directories for additional documentation or downloadable resources like PDF worksheets or lesson plans.
*   `index.html`: (Likely) The main entry point or landing page for the web-based content.
*   Other `.html` files: (Likely) Additional pages for specific topics or units.
*   `LICENSE`: Details the licensing terms for the repository's content.

## Key Files and Responsibilities
*   **`README.md`**: Serves as the primary source of information about the project, its purpose, and potentially how to use or contribute to it.
*   **`index.html` (and other `.html` files)**: These files are responsible for structuring the content of the educational materials, presenting text, images, and potentially links to other resources.
*   **`.css` files (e.g., `style.css` in `/css/`)**: Define the visual styling of the HTML content, including layout, colors, fonts, and responsiveness.
*   **`.js` files (e.g., `script.js` in `/js/`)**: If present, these files would handle any interactive elements, dynamic content loading, or user interface enhancements.
*   **Files in `/images/`**: Provide visual aids and contextual graphics to support the mathematical concepts.
*   **`LICENSE`**: Specifies the legal terms under which the content of the repository can be used, distributed, and modified.

## How to Run Locally
Given the likely nature of this repository as a collection of static web pages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), it can be run locally by:

1.  **Cloning the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/INNODEMS/CBC-Grade-7-Maths.git
    ```
2.  **Navigating into the cloned directory:**
    ```bash
    cd CBC-Grade-7-Maths
    ```
3.  **Opening the main HTML file in a web browser:**
    Locate the `index.html` file (or the primary HTML file if `index.html` is not present) and open it directly with your preferred web browser (e.g., by double-clicking it in your file explorer).

No specific server-side setup or complex build tools are explicitly inferable or expected for a basic static educational resource.

## Possible Improvements
1.  **Detailed Documentation**: Expand the `README.md` to include more specific information about the curriculum covered, target audience, and how to navigate the materials.
2.  **Content Expansion**: Add more topics, examples, exercises, and quizzes to make the learning experience more comprehensive.
3.  **Interactivity**: Incorporate interactive elements using JavaScript, such as draggable components, fill-in-the-blank questions, or immediate feedback for exercises.
4.  **Accessibility**: Ensure the content is accessible to all users by following WCAG guidelines (e.g., alt text for images, proper heading structure, keyboard navigation).
5.  **Responsiveness**: Optimize the design to be fully responsive, ensuring a good user experience across various devices (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).
6.  **Deployment**: Automate deployment to a static hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify) for easy online access.
7.  **Contribution Guidelines**: If open to community contributions, add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to guide potential contributors.
8.  **Version Control Best Practices**: Encourage more descriptive commit messages and potentially a branching strategy for feature development and bug fixes.
