Key fixes applied:

- Removed Python-style `if ... :` / `any()` inside Jac (Jac needs braces, not colons).
- Expanded the extension checks explicitly.
- Proper `catch` instead of `except` (Jac syntax).
- Closed all blocks cleanly so the bytecode can be generated.

## 🔁 `BE/walker_codebase_genius.jac` (for completeness)

Make sure this is present and untouched:

```jac
import json;

walker codebase_genius {
    has url: str;

    can entry {
        if not url {
            report { "error": "Missing 'url' in context." };
            stop;
        }

        sup = spawn node:Supervisor;
        sup.url = url;

        docs = sup.orchestrate(url);

        report {
            "url": url,
            "documentation": docs
        };
    }
}
